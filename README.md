# Learning On Learn

Welcome to Learn! We're so thrilled you've joined our community of learners!

## The Learn Community

Learn is designed for people who are passionate, curious, self-driven, and absolutely serious about learning to code. We are on a never ending quest for knowledge and we know there are no shortcuts.

Most people on Learn have already been learning to code a bit using the amazing and plentiful resources all around the internet. The content on Learn makes no assumptions though and is designed for absolute beginners. However, if you find it impossibly challenging at first, ask for help and an instructor from the community will be so absolutely glad to help.

Learn will demand you to be patient, resilient, resourceful, to work hard, be gritty, and never give up. Isn't that the kind of person you want to be? We think that's the kind of person you already are.

We do our best to write curriculum that is clear, digestible, engaging, challenging, and deep. The curriculum you'll encounter on Learn is rigorous. Expect it to be a little more challenging than other online learning platforms. We don't dumb anything down for you because we believe in your infinite capacity to learn.

Finally, we don't believe in learning alone. As you make progress, expect to bump into other learners just like you, ready and willing to help each other succeed. Together we can go farther than we could ever go alone. We expect everyone on Learn to be friendly, respectful, helpful, and nice. Learn is something special.

## Recap

At this point, you've already created a Learn account, got a local development environment set up, and you've confirmed that the dev environment can talk to Learn. Great!

Now, here you are in Learn, ready to start Learning.

Before you start learning, let's just get a little more familiar with how Learn works. In the handful of lessons that follow, we'll walk you through a few things:

1. How content is organized on Learn
2. How to use the console in Nitrous
3. How Learn uses Git & Github
4. The workflow you'll use to learn to code on Learn

Let's start by talking about different types of curriculum on Learn.

## All About Lessons

The individual pieces of curriculum on Learn are called "lessons".

### Tracks and Navigation

A "track" is composed of many lessons, often organized into topics.

The column to the left is the Track Navigation, allowing you to expand topics and units and move around lessons.

You must complete a lesson before you're able to advance to a future one.

Lessons you've completed will be filled in with a green circle and your current lesson will be orange.

### Lesson Types

There are two types of lessons on Learn: READMEs and Labs.

#### Labs

Labs are lessons that have a coding challenge you must complete. A lab will require you to write code and submit a solution.

All labs include a README that you will see on Learn. The lab README will describe the objectives, overview, and instructions for the code you must write. You should definitely read the lab README. If you're confused at any point, go back to the README.

In the following lessons, we're going to show you how to use `git` and `GitHub` to work on a lab and how to automate everything by using our `Learn CLI`.

You'll know if a lesson on Learn is a lab by the actions the right column asks you to take. Labs will display the following in the right:

#### READMEs

READMEs are lessons that only have instructional content. They are designed to teach you something without challenging you to practice or implement the concept directly. This current lesson is a README.

READMEs provide context and exposition on a topic by breaking concepts down. READMEs are how you learn enough to solve a lab.

As you can probably tell already, Learn is a big fan of the written word. Some READMEs have videos, but our expectation is that you also do the reading. The video augments the content, it does not replace it.

You're going to have to do a lot of reading on Learn. We know other platforms make heavy use of 3-6 minute videos and we're going to continue to experiment with that medium, but for now, the majority of the content on Learn is text. We still believe that with all the details and syntax involved in code, and since being a professional programmer is basically reading and writing text all day, the best way to learn to code is through reading and writing code, not watching videos.

Some READMEs also contain brief interactive elements such as quizzes or little in-browser coding challenges.

Once you've completed a README, you should click the "I'm done" button on the right. The "Next Lesson" button will light up, allowing you to proceed.
